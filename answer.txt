What were the inputs you gave the simulation? (Population size, percent vaccinated, virus name, mortality rate, reproductive rate)
population size: 1000
percent vaccinated : 0.8
virus name: small pox
mortality rate: 0.15
reproductive rate: 0.06

What percentage of the population became infected at some point before the virus burned out?

139/1000
13.9%

What percentage of the population died from the virus?

33/1000
3.3%


Out of all interactions sick individuals had during the entire simulation, how many total interactions did we see where a vaccination saved a person from potentially becoming infected?
